Once a Devcn UI component is installed, you can import it and use it in your application like any other React component. The components are added as part of your codebase (not hidden in a library), so the usage feels very natural.

## Example

Let's say you want to create a chatbot interface using the Devcn UI AI components. Here's how you might compose them together:

```jsx
// ChatInterface.tsx
'use client';

import {
  AIConversation,
  AIMessage,
  AIMessageAvatar,
  AIMessageContent,
  AIResponse,
  AIInput
} from '@/packages/ai/ai';

const ChatInterface = () => (
  <div className="flex flex-col h-[600px]">
    <AIConversation>
      {/* User message */}
      <AIMessage role="user">
        <AIMessageContent>
          How can I use Devcn UI components?
        </AIMessageContent>
        <AIMessageAvatar fallback="U" />
      </AIMessage>
      
      {/* AI response with markdown */}
      <AIMessage role="assistant">
        <AIMessageContent>
          <AIResponse>
            # Devcn UI Components
            
            Devcn UI provides specialized components for AI interfaces. Here's how to use them:
            
            1. Install the component you need
            2. Import it into your React component
            3. Use it in your JSX
            
            Example import:
            import { AIResponse } from '@/packages/ai/ai';
            
            Components are available in your codebase for easy customization.
          </AIResponse>
        </AIMessageContent>
        <AIMessageAvatar fallback="AI" />
      </AIMessage>
    </AIConversation>

    {/* User input */}
    <AIInput placeholder="Ask a question..." />
  </div>
);

export default ChatInterface;
```

In the example above, we import various AI components from our Devcn UI directory and compose them to create a complete chatbot interface. The `AIConversation` component acts as a container for the chat thread, `AIMessage` components represent individual messages with proper styling based on the sender role, and `AIResponse` renders markdown content from the AI assistant. The interface is completed with an `AIInput` component for user interaction.

Feel free to add as many Devcn UI components as you need. Because components are added on-demand, you're not including code for features you aren't using. This keeps your app lean. Each component is isolated, so adding one won't bloat another â€“ yet they all share the same design tokens (colors, fonts, etc.) from shadcn's theme.

## Extensibility

All Devcn UI components take as many primitive attributes as possible. For example, the `AIResponse` component extends `HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`, so you can pass any props that a `div` supports. This makes it easy to extend the component with your own styles or functionality.

## Customization

After installation, no additional setup is needed. The components come with their styles (Tailwind CSS classes) and functionality built-in. You can start using them in your app right away.
