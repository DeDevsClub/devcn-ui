First off, thank you for considering contributing to Devcn UI Design Registry!

The Devcn UI Design Registry is a specialized component library focused on AI chatbot interfaces. It provides a minimal template for projects to build sophisticated AI conversation experiences. This registry is a basic implementation of [Kibo UI](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/kibo), which has a well-defined framework for interface and design system implementation.

We welcome contributions of all kinds – from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new AI conversation components. This guide will help you get started with contributing, including setting up a development environment, our preferred workflow for making changes, and tips for submitting your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute to Devcn UI Design Registry. Feel free to pick the one that best suits your skills and interests.

## Bug Reports & Fixes

If you find a bug, you can open an issue describing it. Even better, if you track down the cause, feel free to submit a pull request with a fix. When fixing a bug, include a clear description of the problem and the solution in your PR. For chatbot interface components, be sure to note any specific AI interaction scenarios where the bug occurs.

## Documentation

Improvements to documentation are very valuable. This could mean fixing typos, clarifying examples, or adding new explanations. If something was unclear to you while using Devcn UI Design Registry, updating the docs to help future users is a great contribution. Documentation on component usage in different AI conversation contexts is especially helpful.

## New Components

Perhaps you built a chatbot interface component that would be useful to others. You can contribute new components to the registry. Components that enhance AI conversation experiences, improve reasoning visualization, or add source attribution features are particularly valuable. (See [Adding New Components](#adding-new-components) below.)

## Enhancements

You might have ideas to enhance existing components (e.g., add a new prop for a feature, improve accessibility, refactor for performance). We welcome these ideas—just make sure to discuss major changes with maintainers (via an issue or discussion) before investing a lot of time, to ensure it aligns with the project goals and the [Kibo UI](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/kibo) framework principles that this registry is based on.
