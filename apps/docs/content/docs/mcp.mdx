description: Devcn UI Design Registry supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-powered chatbot development.
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems. Think of it as a "universal remote" that lets your AI tools access real-world data and functionality.

Devcn UI Design Registry supports MCP to supercharge your AI chatbot development workflow, giving your AI assistant detailed knowledge about our specialized chatbot interface components.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

First, make sure you're using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (Free - recommended for beginners)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (AI-powered code editor)
- [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com/) (AI development platform)
- Other MCP-compatible tools

### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

Depending on your AI tool, you'll need to edit one of these files:

- **Claude Desktop**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **Other tools**: Check your tool's MCP documentation

### Step 3: Add Devcn UI Design Registry Configuration

Copy and paste this configuration into your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devcn-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://devcn-ui.dedevs.com/api/mcp/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

Close and reopen your AI application for the changes to take effect.

### Step 5: Verify the Connection

Test the integration by asking your AI assistant:

> "What Devcn UI Design Registry components are available for building an AI chat interface?"

If successful, your AI should be able to list and explain our specialized chatbot interface components!
